## Overview
This PowerShell script is designed for security analysts and incident responders who need quick visibility into user authentication activity within environments integrated with **CrowdStrike Identity Protection**.

With minimal configuration, you can:
- Authenticate to CrowdStrike API using OAuth.
- Query Identity Protection data for a specific user by `SamAccountName`.
- Retrieve **successful authentication events** from the last X time period (customizable).
- Display results in a formatted table and export to CSV for further analysis or reporting.

---

### ‚úÖ Features
- Uses **CrowdStrike GraphQL API** for rich data queries.
- Supports **time-based filtering** (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 minutes, last month).
- Exports data to **CSV** for integration with SIEMs or custom reporting.
- Supports CrowdStrike regions: **US-1, US-2, EU-1**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- This script uses the `SamAccountName` attribute for lookup. In environments with **multiple domains**, users sharing the same name may cause ambiguity.
- Currently does not support **GovCloud environments**.

- Identity Protection GraphQL - **Write**
- Identity Protection Timeline - **Read**
